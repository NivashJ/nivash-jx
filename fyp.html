                            <p>As part of the requirements to fulfill my undergraduate degree, I was expected to undertake a research project
                                that best displayed my interest in the field of linguistics. Over the course of two semesters, I completed a socioinguistics dissertation on the state of Tamil in Singapore.

                            <p>Having an interest in the field of Language Maintenance and Language Shift (LMLS) and minortiy languages, I used this 
                                opportunity to investigate the realities of how the linguistic phenomena of language shift has affected the Tamil community.

                        <p>While all three main ethnic groups have experienced language shift, the Tamils and the wider Indian community have been at the forefront of conversations surrounding the shift to English.
                        The Indians of Singapore were the first of the three main ethnic groups to shift to English. Consequentially, Tamil was the only official language to have been overtaken by English in 2010.

                            <p>The concerning downward trend of reported Tamil use at home has sparked questions on the future of the language in Singapore;
                                many have predicted that Tamil will soon be moribund as a spoken lanaguage in the country. The paper investigates the language use, attitudes and core values of Tamil Singaporeans to paint a 
                                a more nuanced picture of Tamils' language siutation which the census is unable to capture. The results of the study indicated a future for Tamil
                                that is not quite as bleak as the existing literature suggets. It was found that Tamil is still being spoken at 
                                a considerable amount by certain segments of the community such as those of belonging to the lower income groups.

                            <p>I was invited by the School of Humanities (SoH) to showcase the paper as one of the top Final Year Projects during a
                                pre-admission event; it was also featured on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CrR9ypABNCW/">SoH social media page</a> as part of outreach efforts to attract potential students to the school.
                                A PDF of the paper is available for download below.
